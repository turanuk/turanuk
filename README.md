### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jim and I work on various projects at GitHub, as well as on the Microsoft App Center product. 

ðŸ’¬ Areas I am really passionate about are on-call/operations, helping people, and shipping great software.

âš¡ Fun fact: turanuk (TER-ah-nuck) is a word I made up because "Jim Wang" was frequently taken.
